# Electronics Labs

This repository contains my lab exercises and related materials from the **Electronics course**.  
It was originally hosted on GitLab and has been mirrored here to my personal GitHub account for reference, documentation, and portfolio purposes.

## 📘 Overview

The course focused on the **fundamentals of electronics** — covering both theoretical and practical aspects of **analog and digital circuit design**.  
The labs involved building, testing, and analyzing circuits while learning to use various measurement tools and simulation software.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Understand and apply **Ohm’s Law**, **Kirchhoff’s Laws**, and basic circuit analysis  
- Learn about **resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and operational amplifiers**  
- Build and measure circuits using **breadboards and lab instruments**  
- Interpret oscilloscope and multimeter data  
- Gain experience with **SPICE simulation tools** and documentation practices  
- Strengthen hands-on problem-solving skills in electronics

## 🧪 Lab Instructions

Each lab consists of:
1. **Pre-lab preparation** — circuit design, component calculations, and simulation  
2. **Lab work** — building and testing the circuit on a breadboard or simulator  
3. **Measurements and analysis** — collecting oscilloscope data and interpreting results  
4. **Post-lab report** — summarizing findings, results, and conclusions  

All required code, schematics, and documentation are included in their respective folders.
